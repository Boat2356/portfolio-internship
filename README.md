### Weather Data Pipeline with Apache Airflow (_Feb 2024 - May 2024_)
[View Project](https://github.com/Boat2356/Data-pipeline-with-apache-airflow)

#### Tools Used
- Apache Airflow: Orchestrating the ETL process
- Docker: Containerizing the application for portability
- Visual Studio Code: Code editor for development
- DBeaver: PostgreSQL database management and querying

#### About Meteostat API
- Provides access to historical weather and climate data via a JSON API.
- Data can be filtered by weather station or location, with optional parameters.
- API endpoint: [Meteostat Developers](https://dev.meteostat.net/api/stations/daily.html)

#### Process Overview
- Objective: The DAG is designed to fetch, clean, and store weather data in a PostgreSQL database.
  
#### Workflow
- Task 1: extract_data_from_API – Fetches weather data for the previous day from the Meteostat API.
- Task 2: read_and_clean_csv – Cleans the raw weather data, filling missing values and formatting.
- Task 3: fetch_and_display_data – Fetches and displays the data from the PostgreSQL database.
- Task Execution Order: extract_data_from_API → 2. read_and_clean_csv → 3. fetch_and_display_data
